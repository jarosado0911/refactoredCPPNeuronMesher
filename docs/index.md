## About
CPPNeuronMesher is a C++ project designed for the geometric analysis and mesh generation of neuron morphologies, providing tools for advanced neuroscience modeling and simulation. The repository features robust CI/CD pipelines, extensive quality checks, and detailed documentation to support reproducibility and collaborative development. CPPNeuronMesher is a C++ toolkit for analyzing neuron geometries and generating computational meshes from neuron morphology data (primarily in the `.swc` format). The project provides both command-line tools for mesh operations, and a lightweight OpenGL-based 3D viewer for visualizing neuron structures.

Main features include:
- Parsing and analyzing neuron morphologies in `.swc` format.
- Automated mesh generation, refinement, and trunk extraction for neuron models.
- A fast, interactive 3D neuron viewer with rotation, zoom, and multiple visualization modes.
- Python bindings (`neurongraph` shared library).
- Modular CMake build system with continuous integration and quality analysis.
- Example scripts and utilities for advanced mesh and data manipulation.

## Examples
In this section we discuss the example scripts and show the `neuronviewer` application I designed for visualizing `.swc` and `.ugx` neuron geometry specifications.
### NeuronViewer: A 3D Visualization Tool for Neuronal Morphology
`neuronviewer` is a lightweight, OpenGL-powered interactive application designed for real-time visualization of neuron morphologies encoded in `.swc` and `.ugx` formats. Built with C++ and GLFW, it allows researchers to explore neuron structures through intuitive 3D navigation and rich rendering options.

üß† Core Features
Real-time 3D rendering of .swc neuron files using OpenGL.
- Interactive controls:
- Rotate with mouse drag
- Zoom with scroll wheel
- Pan and explore 3D space
- Multi-mode rendering with six distinct visual styles:
- Edges only (uniform)
- Nodes only (uniform or by radius)
- Edges and nodes (with or without radius-based scaling)
- Automatic lighting, bounding box, and color-coded nodes by SWC type.
- Dynamic help window showing usage instructions and current file metadata.

üß∞ Technical Highlights
- Utilizes GLFW for window and input management.
- Uses GLU to draw spheres and cylinders representing nodes and neurites.
- Employs a modular rendering pipeline with lighting and material settings.
- Efficient font rendering using stb_easy_font for overlay/help text.
- Help window rendered via a second GLFW context (renderhelpwindow.cpp) with orthographic projection and line-by-line formatting.
