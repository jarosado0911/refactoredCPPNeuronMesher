## About
CPPNeuronMesher is a C++ project designed for the geometric analysis and mesh generation of neuron morphologies, providing tools for advanced neuroscience modeling and simulation. The repository features robust CI/CD pipelines, extensive quality checks, and detailed documentation to support reproducibility and collaborative development. CPPNeuronMesher is a C++ toolkit for analyzing neuron geometries and generating computational meshes from neuron morphology data (primarily in the `.swc` format). The project provides both command-line tools for mesh operations, and a lightweight OpenGL-based 3D viewer for visualizing neuron structures.

Main features include:
- Parsing and analyzing neuron morphologies in `.swc` format.
- Automated mesh generation, refinement, and trunk extraction for neuron models.
- A fast, interactive 3D neuron viewer with rotation, zoom, and multiple visualization modes.
- Python bindings (`neurongraph` shared library).
- Modular CMake build system with continuous integration and quality analysis.
- Example scripts and utilities for advanced mesh and data manipulation.
