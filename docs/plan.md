# Analysis & Assess

## Notes
- User requested an analysis of neurongraph.cpp and an assessment of its documentation.
- The file uses Doxygen-style comments for most functions and methods.
- Some referenced methods (e.g., setSoma, removeSomaSegment) are not present in neurongraph.cpp; may be implemented elsewhere or missing.
- removeSomaSegment is implemented in neuronoperations.cpp.
- User requested analysis and documentation generation for neuronoperations.cpp methods.
- All methods in neuronoperations.cpp are now documented with Doxygen-style comments.
- User requested analysis and documentation generation for bindings.cpp methods.
- All methods in bindings.cpp are now documented with Doxygen-style and inline comments.
- User requested analysis and documentation generation for neurontrunks.cpp methods.
- All methods in neurontrunks.cpp are now documented with Doxygen-style comments.
- Function declaration syntax issues (dot vs. scope resolution operator) were found in neurontrunks.cpp and are being addressed.
- Doxygen documentation is being (re)added to all methods in neurontrunks.cpp per user request; several methods are now complete.
- User requested documentation for neuronugx.cpp.
- File-level and method-level Doxygen documentation has been added to neuronugx.cpp (writeToFileUGX, readFromFileUGX).
- User requested documentation for utils.cpp.
- File-level and method-level Doxygen documentation has been added to utils.cpp.
- User requested documentation for callbacks.cpp.
- File-level and method-level Doxygen documentation has been added to callbacks.cpp.
- User requested documentation for draw_utils.cpp.
- File-level and method-level Doxygen documentation has been added to draw_utils.cpp.
- User requested documentation for globals.cpp and opgl_utils.cpp.
- File-level Doxygen documentation has been added to globals.cpp.
- File-level and method-level Doxygen documentation has been added to opgl_utils.cpp.
- User requested documentation for all header files in include/project and include/viewer directories.
- Documentation for neurongraph.h in include/project has been added.
- Documentation for utils.h in include/project has been added.
- Documentation for draw_utils.h in include/viewer has been added.
- Documentation for callbacks.h in include/viewer has been added.
- Documentation for globals.h in include/viewer has been added.
- Documentation for opgl_utils.h in include/viewer has been added.
- User reported a possible bug: radius information appears magnified in neuronviewer.cpp; investigation into how radius is handled/scaled is required.
- Radius scaling bug fixed: drawSimpleSphere now uses node.radius in renderSWC, so spheres now reflect actual SWC radii.
- New issue: soma node (id 1, pid -1) appears too large; need to investigate if special handling or scaling for soma nodes is required.
